This is a simple select-based chatserver.

There's a cool secret feature using UNIX domain sockets
where you can pass a client to another process and then
back in again.

There's a simple authentication process that can be easily
modified to use anything else. Users are built-in to the
auth program.

To build: run "make"

Tested on Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
